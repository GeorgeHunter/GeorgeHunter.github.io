I'm a front end developer and designer working for stellasoft in Frome, Somerset. Day to day I'm responsible for building and maintaining the front end of a variety of websites and applications. I'm responsible for the development of websites and apps, as well as a large part of the UX design.

My passion is creating a great user experience, through clever design and strong performance. Websites and applications should be easy to use, fast and beautiful. Too often these things can come at the expense of one or both of the others, but I strive to prevent this happening.

I've been doing this now for about 7 months and in that time I've worked on some great projects
