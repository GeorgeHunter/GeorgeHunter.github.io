  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’m a front end developer and designer working for stellasoft in Frome, Somerset. Day to day I’m responsible for building and maintaining the front end of a variety of websites and applications. I’m responsible for the development of websites and apps, as well as a large part of the UX design.</p>

<p>My passion is creating a great user experience, through clever design and strong performance. Websites and applications should be easy to use, fast and beautiful. Too often these things can come at the expense of one or both of the others, but I strive to prevent this happening.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing this now for about 7 months and in that time I’ve worked on some great projects</p>

<h3 id="web-design-and-development">Web Design and Development</h3>

<p>I’m responsible for a variety of web work - ranging from SME websites to large portals. I’m involved in the whole process from the initial requirements to final delivery. Along the way I work with a team on UX design, build and development process, testing and client support. Each project requires a variety of skills and working on a small team has forced my skill set to broaden - pushing me outside of my comfort zone.</p>

<h3 id="application-development">Application Development</h3>

<p>I’ve worked on a broad range of hybrid mobile applications. I’m involved from the start, working on UX design and then typically having to rapidly develop the views. The work will typically broaden in scope throughout the project so creating reusable components that will allow developers to continue working and adding features without having to come back to me is an important skill.</p>

<h3 id="email-development">Email Development</h3>

<p>I have experience building HTML emails, making sure they are responsive and work in a broad range of email clients. </p>
