#Learning to *use* Wordpress

Wordpress is one of those things that I've used, and used reasonably well, but without ever really diving into it. There's a 'Wordpress Way' and it never really interested me. It was a tool I used because clients wanted a CMS and Wordpress seemed as good as any.

I've tried to change that in the last couple of weeks. Instead of seeing it as a necessary evil I've started looking at what it has to offer - what it can do to make my life easier. And I have to admit, I've been impressed.

Wordpress gets a bad rap for a lot of things, chiefly security and performance.
