Everything is now up and running...

So how was the whole process? Well it was relatively painfree. Setting everything up was very straightforward. You just need a github repo with a specific name (username.github.io), and you push whatever site you want to that. So for the last couple of months I just had a holding page, a single index.html saying something was coming soon. Really it was a lie, I never planned on putting something up there (or more accurately, had no idea what I should put there).

I made an attempt at setting up a Jekyll site and all I really achieved was breaking my sass gem. Seems the listen ruby gem doesn't play nice with it. But then, about a week ago I got a Macbook Air and given how easily ruby related stuff seems to work with it I thought I'd give Jekyll another go. Minutes later I was up and running.

So now I was curious, what could I actually do. At this point I'd usually make up a company or some client and do a site for that. But I figured this time I'd so something slightly different, and shock horror, actually make a personal site. This turned out to be quite a good idea, because instead of making up content or imagining client meetings I just started building. 

Coming into this I had no experience with either markdown or the liquid templating system but both were straightforward enough to pick up. Markdown is beautiful in its simplicity and I was pleasantly surprised with liquid. I'm coming from a wordpress background so it was fun to work with something so lightweight.
